abstract = {This paper focuses on the challenges of modeling
cyber-physical systems that arise from the
intrinsic heterogeneity, concurrency, and
sensitivity to timing of such systems. It uses a
portion of an aircraft vehicle management systems
(VMS), specifically the fuel management subsystem,
to illustrate the challenges, and then discusses
technologies that at least partially address the
challenges. Specific technologies described
include hybrid system modeling and simulation,
concurrent and heterogeneous models of
computation, the use of domain-specific ontologies
to enhance modularity, and the joint modeling of
functionality and implementation architectures.},
