class IActuatorPWM

-- class representing a PWM-controlled motor
-- accepts a real number in the range (-1,1)
-- designed to be connected to a co-simulation

types

-- restricted to (-1,1)
public PWM = real

operations

-- write a value to this actuator
public Write: PWM ==> ()
Write(v) == is subclass responsibility;

-- read the value written to this actuator
public Read: () ==> PWM
Read() == is subclass responsibility;
