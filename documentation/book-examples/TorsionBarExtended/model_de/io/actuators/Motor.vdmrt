class Motor is subclass of IActuatorPWM

-- class representing a PWM-controlled motor
-- accepts a real number in the range (-1,1)
-- designed to be connected to a co-simulation

instance variables

-- this value will be set through the co-simulation
protected val: real := 0;

operations

-- write a value to this actuator
public Write: PWM ==> ()
Write(v) == val := v;

-- read the value written to this actuator
public Read: () ==> PWM
Read() == return val;

end Motor
