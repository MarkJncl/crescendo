class PWM is subclass of IActuatorPWM

-- Class representing a PWM actuator.
-- This actuator accepts a real number in the range -1 to 1.
-- This class is designed to be connected to a co-simulation.



operations

-- write a value to this actuator
public Write: IActuatorPWM`PWM ==> ()
Write(v) == value := v;

-- read the value written to this actuator
public Read: () ==> IActuatorPWM`PWM
Read() == return value;
