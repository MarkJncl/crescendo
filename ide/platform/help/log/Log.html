<h1>Logging in Crescendo</h1>
<br />
Logging can be done in both VDM and 20-Sim by either selecting the variables to log in the launch configuration as shown in the picture below or by simply selecting &quot;Save Data File&quot; on a 20-sim plot.<br />

<br />
When the simulation finished a DataFromFile source can be added to a 20-sim model as shown in the figure below:<br />

<br />
Then both the data file from VDM and 20-sim can be imported like this and plottet. <font size="4" color="#FF0000"><strong>You cannot use the 20-sim variable you want to compare the VDM variable with directly since the &quot;play&quot; button will wrongly run the simulation again without the DE side and produce fake results with no warning.</strong></font>
