        <p>
        The Crescendo platform is a tool that bridge the gap between the disciplines involved in designing an embedded system:
systems, control, mechanical and software engineering, for example. These
disciplines, which have grown up separately, base design on different forms of
model - some use discrete event models, and some use continuous time -
inhibiting our ability to compare design alternatives rapidly and in particular
to model faults and fault tolerance mechanisms that have to cross the
boundaries between models. This "design gap" leads to sub-optimal designs and
long development lead times.
        </p>
		<p>
            This tool combines continuous time system models with discrete
event controller models through co-simulation to allow multidisciplinary
modelling, including modelling of faults and fault tolerance mechanisms. The
analysis of these effects at every stage in a design process will help to build
more dependable real-time embedded systems.&nbsp; The tool here is the platform
including support for the Discrete Event formalism VDM and its open source
platform called Overture and the Continuous Time formalism called 20-sim.</p>

Crescendo is a musical term for "gradually becoming louder" and here we hope that the loudness can be seen as impact on industrial applications using this technology. Crescendo can also be seen as an acronym for: "Collaborative Requirements, Exploration and Simulation of Cyber-Physical-Systems, Environments and Networks Developed in Overture" but this is so long that we do not expect to use it for that.
