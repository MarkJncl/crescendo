        <p>
            The DESTECS (Design Support and Tooling for Embedded Control 
			Software) project focus on developing design methods and tools that 
			bridge the gap between the disciplines involved in designing an 
			embedded system: systems, control, mechanical and software 
			engineering, for example. These disciplines, which have grown up 
			separately, base design on different forms of model - some use 
			discrete event models, and some use continuous time - inhibiting our 
			ability to compare design alternatives rapidly and in particular to 
			model faults and fault tolerance mechanisms that have to cross the 
			boundaries between models. This “design gap” leads to sub-optimal 
			designs and long development lead times.
        </p>
		<p>
            We aim to develop methods and tools that that combine continuous 
			time system models with discrete event controller models through 
			co-simulation to allow multidisciplinary modelling, including 
			modelling of faults and fault tolerance mechanisms. The analysis of 
			these effects at every stage in a design process will help to build 
			more dependable real-time embedded systems.&nbsp; The tool here is 
			the platform including support for the Discrete Event formalism VDM 
			and its open source platform called Overture and the Continuous Time 
			formalism called 20-sim.</p>
